# Partitioning-an-area-with-minimum-waste
The aim here is to reduce the area which does not belong any partition. For example, let our farmers have a field of (7 x 10) and the smallest area needed for a group of plant might be (6 x 5) and (1 x 9) for another group. They can use the same group more than once.  However, the width and the length is fixed for a group of plant considering the watering and optimal case for sunlight etc. In other words, an area for a plant is not open to rotation.   What is the minimum area wasted by not planting anything?,
